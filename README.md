# Taranis Lua Scripts

Contains a Glider-Telemetry screen (gldr*.lua)

## Informations

As there is currently no configuration code implemented, you need to configure the screen in the script.
Because of that there are currently 3 scripts for 1S Lipo, 2S Lipo and 4S NimH

In the future I will enhance the script, so it can be configured per model.

## TODO
* Add a contextmenu that is accessed by long press of menu when on the telemetry screen
* Navigation Concept / Edit Value Concept needed
* Make Akku Type and Cell Count configureable
* Make every area a "widget" that can be displayed as a full height block or a smaller version
* try other sensors like Unisens-E to build more widgets
* Make Widgets configureable
